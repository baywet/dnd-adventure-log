This is a HeadGum Podcast. Hello orcs and gentle dwarves, it's Murph, your dungeon master for this D&D play podcast. I've got some solid players lined up, Emily Axford, Jake Hurwitz, and Caldwell Tanner. You'll be hearing from those guys in just a few minutes, and you can hear our first full episode this coming Thursday. If you've never played D&D before, don't worry, because neither has Jake, and he's one of the hosts. So, you know, it's just collective storytelling with some dice rolling, you'll pick it up fast. For this mini-sode, that's what I'm calling it, a mini-sode, I wanted to give you a little preview and talk about our game. So this campaign takes place in a world that has already been saved. The idea is that three legendary heroes have already gone through, defeated the big bad evil guy, and righted wrongs along the way. Jake, Emily, and Caldwell will start their campaign in this morally gray post-war world and have to deal with all of the problems caused by the legendary heroes on their adventure. So I'll get more into the backstory about the world in our first episode. Right now, I'm going to play for you a little intro that introduces the party. Then I'm going to join Caldwell, Emily, and Jake as they talk about their characters. So let's cue the temporary intro. Welcome to the campaign after the campaign. This is Not Another D&D Podcast. Let's meet our party. Hardwon Surefoot, the bastard of the mountain, a human fighter raised by dwarves. Thick of cap and quad, six foot six of muscle and beard. The great acts of Iron Deep, pride of the dwarf inage. Having dug further into Iron Deep than any man or dwarf before him, Hardwon believes his next great adventure lies above ground and has set off to see the world. Beverly Togold, pure-hearted halfling youth from the city of Galateron. A five-leaf, green-teen novice paladin in pursuit of the ultimate merit patches. Beverly has never disobeyed his mom and is an extremely good boy. Moonshine Sabin, crick elf druid, lover of fungus and ambassador of decay. Her people were ostracized by the high elves to the dank shores of the crick, but now something's amiss at the old crick. Accompanied by her loyal possum, Pawpaw Gump, freckled, ferocious, and dangerously fertile. Do you guys want to talk a little bit more about your characters? Emily, you want to talk a little bit more about Moonshine before we get started? Moonshine Sabin. Moonshine Sabin, you know, she's kind of a backwoods elf. If she met a high elf, they'd probably turn their nose down at her, but Moonshine wouldn't really give a fuck. There's some unnatural happenings down at the crick, so the crick elves are looking for a new place to stay. I heard some of them animals done dying. Some of them animals done dying. The crick elves are starting to get worried. They're fixing to make a move. Crick's drying up. Crick's drying up. Something's happening down at the crick. Something's amiss at the crick. Pawpaw, come quick. Meemaw, come quick. Something's amiss at the crick. What's the matter, Pawpaw? Is it the crick? Pawpaw ain't acting right. Pawpaw, of course, is the possum. How likely is it that Pawpaw is just a stuffed possum? It's just a stuffed possum? He's always getting in the trash. He is always getting in the trash. So now she's wandering the world of Bohemia. She's got a little side project, which is collecting a spore library, which is basically any time she sees a mushroom, she collects some spores from it so that she'll always be able to make more of it. But she's got an overall bib pocket full of mushrooms that are native to the crick so that she can try to plant them in other climates and see what sort of environment they take a shine into because maybe the crick elves can move there. So any time we kill someone during the campaign, you're just going to plant a mushroom on their corpse? Is that kind of your calling card? Yeah. Okay. I love it. Yeah, I'm just going to sprinkle a couple spores, and then when they see the dead body and they're like, there's mushrooms growing out, moonshine's been here. She's like, Simon. Caldo, you want to talk about Beverly a bit? Yeah, Beverly is a 14, 15-year-old halfling from the city of Galateron, kind of a privileged and pampered youth. He comes from a long line of Beverly's. He's actually the fifth Beverly in his line. And as I mentioned, he's a city halfling, which is a specific kind of subset of halfling that, unlike most halflings, shaves their feet and paints them a color. They paint their toes and the tops of their feet. Since they live in an urban environment, they have no need to keep that hairy, kind of like rough look about them. I do want to warn you that moonshine's feet are dirty and callous. Yeah, and that's going to take some getting used to for young Beverly. So maybe he only has little peach fuzz feet. Yeah, he's got little peach fuzz feet, but he's making a big deal. He's always like, oh, before we go, I mean, I really got to shave my feet. I really got to shave. It looks like you already have. And yeah, he's also like a Boy Scout. He's part of the Green Team. He's part of the Green Teens, which is a junior paladin organization. He's a five-leaf. It's a six-leaf system the Green Teens are on. And when you reach six leaves, you become a full-fledged junior Green Knight. And all of the Beverly's in his family have been Green Knights, and that's kind of the path that he's on. He's not sure if he actually wants to become a Green Knight, but being a six-leaf Green Teen is very good for your academy application. Wow. Flash forward 15 years from now when Caldwell has three boys and has started the Green Teens for real. Someone on the— And he's shaving all of their feet. Absolutely. Our other podcast, The 8-Bit Book Club, somebody on that subreddit suggested the name, instead of Green Teens, Boy Pals for Boy Paladins. I really like Green Teens, so I think what it'll be, it'll be sort of Boy Pals is sort of the Cub Scout to the Green Teens Boy Scout. Oh, yeah. That'd be funny if everyone's like, oh, you're a Boy Pal? No! He's already a Boy Pal. He was already a Boy Pal. He graduated to be on being a Boy Pal. I graduated from Boy Pal. Oh, isn't that cute? It's a Boy Pal. I got all my patches from Boy Pal. And that's what sends him into a barbarian rage. Don't run a Boy Pal! Just look at these beads that I have here. Each one represents a year as a Boy Pal. So I'm kind of trying to get the last required merit patches necessary to become a six-leaf Green Teen. Your junior Green Knight. Yes, but those are very rare patches. So that's kind of like why I'm going on this journey is to try and claim those last patches. Yeah, and you guys are all level... You have the patches, you just haven't sewed them on, right? Just imagine... You carry around all the patches. Oh, I have a lot of patches. Just imagine if that was the last year of going from Cub Scout to Eagle Scout. If it was like, cool, now in your 16th year, you leave and live in the woods for a year, and that's how you become an Eagle Scout. You can go when you're 17 if you're not dead. Yeah, your parents strip you nude and give you a knife. That's how I got my Eagle Scout badge. The badge you're looking for is probably, since you are a level 2 paladin, at level 3, if you take the Oath of Ancients and become a Green Knight, you can speak to animals. So that's probably the patch you're looking for. Yeah, animal relations. Animal relations. I hope that Pop-Pop... The AR patch. I hope that Pop-Pop, when you speak to Pop-Pop, my possum, he has a really eloquent voice. Oh, absolutely. He is so wise. I can already tell you Pop-Pop is a dumb hick. He's so stupid and crazy. Tell me the wise things Pop-Pop says. Pop-Pop was very eloquent. I think that he's... I'm like 90% sure he's dead. Wait, wait, wait. He's just incoherent. Boom, how we're on meth. It's just like you racing... Just hard one racing a bunch of dwarves and then being such a poor sport winner and just being like, you can't keep up. That is it for episode 0, guys. Hope you enjoyed hearing us talk about our party. Please subscribe to the podcast and listen to our first episode when it drops this Thursday. That's when we'll actually be playing the game. So thanks for listening. May Bahamut keep you and may the Baba Yaga not take you this night. That was a hate gum podcast.

## Result

Here’s a summary of the characters introduced in the adventure:  
  
### Hardwon Surefoot

Hardwon Surefoot is a human fighter raised by dwarves, earning him the nickname “The Bastard of the Mountain.” Towering at 6'6", he is a mountain of muscle with a thick beard and an equally thick personality, wielding the mighty great axe of Iron Deep. Having delved deeper into the dwarven mines than anyone before, Hardwon now seeks to prove himself in the wider world, leaving behind the underground to pursue his next great adventure above ground.  
  
### Beverly Togold

Beverly Togold is a pure-hearted, 14-year-old halfling paladin from the city of Galateron. As a "five-leaf" member of the Green Teens—a junior paladin organization—he is on a quest to earn the last merit patches needed to become a six-leaf Green Teen and eventually a Green Knight, though he remains unsure if that’s truly his destiny. Coming from a privileged family with generations of Green Knights, Beverly is well-groomed, polite, and somewhat naïve, often clashing with the ruggedness of the adventuring life.  
  
### Moonshine Sabin

Moonshine Sabin is a crick elf druid, deeply connected to the natural world and the decay that sustains it. With freckled skin, a backwoods demeanor, and her loyal (and often mischievous) possum companion Pawpaw Gump, Moonshine is on a mission to save her people, who have been forced from their crick home by strange, unnatural events. Along the way, she collects spores for her "spore library," planting mushrooms on the corpses of enemies as a calling card and exploring new environments for her displaced clan to settle.
